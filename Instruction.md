Practice Machine Learning with Logistic Regression

1. Using Titanic from seaborn
    - Target = survived
    - Feature = pclass, sex, age, fare

2. Check missing value and if there missing value fill it.
3. Check multicollinearity
4. Split data menjadi train dan test set dengan proporsi 80:20
5. Make Logistic regression model
6. Make intrepertation with summary result
7. Check and intrepert model accuracy with test set
